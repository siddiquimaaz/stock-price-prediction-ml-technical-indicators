# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning & Technical Indicators

A comprehensive Python project for predicting stock and commodity prices using machine learning models, real-time market data, and a wide range of technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, EMA, and more.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time stock and ETF data via [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- 📈 Technical analysis indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA, SMA, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- 🤖 Machine Learning models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- 🧠 Future price prediction for customizable time horizons (1, 3, 5, 10 days)
- 📈 Visualizations: Actual vs Predicted, residuals, scatter plots
- 🪙 Works with stocks, commodities, crypto, and ETFs (e.g. AAPL, GLD, BTC-USD)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (machine learning)
- `yfinance` (financial data API)

## 🛆 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siddiquimaaz/stock-price-prediction-ml-technical-indicators.git
cd stock-price-prediction-ml-technical-indicators
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🧲 How It Works

1. Fetch historical and real-time data using Yahoo Finance.
2. Compute technical indicators to enhance feature representation.
3. Train multiple regression models to predict future prices.
4. Evaluate using metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R².
5. Recommend trading signals (Buy / Sell / Hold).

## 📈 Example Output

```
💰 Real-time Price: $150.25
📈 Predicted Price (5 days): $157.30
🚀 Expected Return: +4.7%
📉 Signal: MODERATE BUY
```
